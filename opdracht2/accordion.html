                <p>The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted. 
                    Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. 
                    But innovative design always develops in tandem with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.</p>

                <summary>Good design makes a product useful</summary>
                <p>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. 
                    Good design emphasises the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</p>

                <summary>Good design is aesthetic</summary>
                <p>The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness because products we use every day affect our person and our well-being. 
                    But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.</p>
